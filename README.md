# Project 3: Chat Rooms

For this project we were tasked to create a website where users can sign in with a username, create chat rooms, and be able to communicate 

## What does each file contain?

### HTML templates:

1. Header
> Top bar of the page. This includes buttons to reach the signup, change user, and displays the current chat you're in.

2. Index
> Main page. Displays simple text welcoming users to the website and saying the main feature of the website.

3. Login
> Users visiting the page for the first time must input a display name to begin chatting.


4. Chats
> Search for chat rooms or create a new chat room which others can access as well.

5. Chat
> Chat room. Chat with others in the same chat room, delete your messages (if needed).

### JavaScript:

1. Chat
>  This is where all of the logic that controls the behavior of the chat room is. Messages are loaded, sent, and deleted using this.
